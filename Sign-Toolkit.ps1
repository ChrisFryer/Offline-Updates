#  Sign-Toolkit.ps1  -  SIGN THE TOOLKIT'S SCRIPTS WITH YOUR CODE-SIGNING CERTIFICATE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Where PowerShell's execution policy is AllSigned, or application control
#  (AppLocker / WDAC script rules and similar products) trusts only signed
#  scripts, every .ps1 the tool runs needs an Authenticode signature from a
#  certificate that policy trusts - otherwise PowerShell refuses the file,
#  or runs it in ConstrainedLanguage mode, where the window cannot start.
#  This script signs them all in one go with YOUR organisation's code-
#  signing certificate, then reports each file's signature.
#
#  WHAT NEEDS A SIGNATURE (tested under AllSigned, 2026-10-21): the .ps1
#  files only - the launcher, lib\ and this script.  The
#  data files (data\*.psd1, read with Import-PowerShellDataFile or the
#  parser), the JSON files the tool writes and the script blocks it sends
#  to the servers are not checked by the execution policy.  So the
#  Software tab can still register packages in data\software-packages.psd1
#  after signing, and nothing has to be signed on the servers.
#
#  SIGN LAST: any later edit of a .ps1 breaks its signature (HashMismatch)
#  and an AllSigned policy refuses that file.  Sign again after every
#  update.  The About tab shows the signature of every script.
#
#  TRUST, on every PC that runs the tool (usually by Group Policy): the
#  issuing CA in Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and for AllSigned
#  without a prompt the signing certificate in Trusted Publishers.  For
#  application control: a publisher rule for the certificate.  A PC that
#  does not trust the chain refuses the files under AllSigned with the
#  misleading "is not digitally signed" - run -Check there to see why.
#
#  Run it on the PC that holds the certificate and its private key:
#    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Sign-Toolkit.ps1
#        lists the code-signing certificates you can use
#    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Sign-Toolkit.ps1 -Thumbprint <thumbprint>
#        signs the tool: the launcher, every lib\*.ps1 and this script
#    ... -Thumbprint <thumbprint> -TimestampServer <url of an RFC 3161 timestamp service>
#        adds a timestamp, so the signatures stay valid after the certificate expires
#    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Sign-Toolkit.ps1 -Check
#        reports every file's signature and signs nothing
#  The timestamp is the ONLY network call this script can make, and only
#  when -TimestampServer is given (an internal timestamp authority works).
#  The toolkit itself never goes online.
#  Exit code 0 = every file signed (or, with -Check, every file read).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  REVIEW RECORD  -  Sign-Toolkit.ps1
#  New 2026-10-21.  2026-10-26: signs only the lib files the launcher
#  loads (read from its list with the parser).  Nothing here talks to a
#  server; the timestamp server is the one optional network call.
