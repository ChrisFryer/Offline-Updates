# =====================================================================
#  Start-WinRMToolkit.ps1  -  THE ENTRY POINT  (PowerShell 5.1, WinForms)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Sysadmin WinRM Toolkit: five consoles over one WinRM engine.
#    O/S Patching - patch status and installs (Windows + .NET updates), reboots, roles, software currency
#    Software     - third-party software: stage, install / update (reboot suppressed), remove
#    Health       - services, tasks, failed logons, dormant software, SOE standards
#    Security     - ISM audit with a security profile, tailoring and traffic lights
#  plus the Commands tab (one command on the ticked servers, with a cheat sheet), the Code Tour,
#  Settings (confirmations, change records, log, thresholds) and About tabs.
#
#  HOW TO RUN  (from this file - .ps1 execution must be allowed on the PC)
#    A) Normal:   right-click this file -> "Run with PowerShell", or
#                 powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Start-WinRMToolkit.ps1
#       Where the execution policy is AllSigned, or application control (AppLocker, WDAC and similar)
#       only trusts signed scripts, sign the scripts first: Sign-Toolkit.ps1 (README, "Code signing").
#    B) Functions only, no window (fault finding):  $NoGui = $true; . .\Start-WinRMToolkit.ps1
#
#  Run it as the user who is an administrator on the target servers; it never
#  elevates itself and every credential prompt appears in the foreground.
#  TRUST BOUNDARY: everything in this folder runs as YOU on EVERY server.  Keep the
#  folder writable only by the operators (not on an open share).
# =====================================================================
#Requires -Version 5.1

#  REVIEW RECORD  -  Start-WinRMToolkit.ps1
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Version 1 review (as Start-OfflinePatcher.ps1, see CODE-REVIEW.md): R-25, R-27, R-29, R-30, R-33.
#  Version 2: renamed; loads the new building blocks (09, 10, 20, 30, 40).  2026-10-19: the
#  old-name shim was removed.  2026-10-21: the all-in-one text and its paste mode were retired
#  (requirement dropped); the tool runs from its files only.  Later the same day: 12-Settings, the
#  Settings and About consoles, the saved settings applied at start-up, log retention, and the
#  ConstrainedLanguage message points at code signing (Sign-Toolkit.ps1).  2026-10-22: the Commands
#  console (80-Console-Commands.ps1).

# 1. Language mode.  Application control (AppLocker / WDAC script rules and similar) runs a script it does not trust
#    in ConstrainedLanguage: no Add-Type, no WinForms, no .NET.  A script the policy trusts - signed with a certificate
#    it allows - runs in FullLanguage.
