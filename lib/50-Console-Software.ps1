#  50-Console-Software.ps1  -  THE SOFTWARE CONSOLE (deploy, update, remove)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Third-party software, handled the way OS patches are:
#    - a catalogue, data\software-packages.psd1: what may be deployed, how
#      (the exact silent command line, the reboot always suppressed), where
#      (VMware Tools on VMware virtual machines only) and in which modes
#      (Install, Update, Uninstall)
#    - installer files in software\<package Id>\, vetted here: version,
#      Authenticode signer named in the catalogue, SHA256
#    - STAGE ONLY copies an installer ahead of the change window; INSTALL /
#      UPDATE runs it with the reboot suppressed, so one reboot ("Reboot
#      ticked servers") finishes both the OS patches and the software
#    - UNINSTALL removes ticked products (MSI product code, or the product's
#      own QuietUninstallString) - never a protected product, never one the
#      server's SOE standard requires
#  Every install, update and removal goes through: a fresh check, the plan,
#  the change record (11-ChangeLog.ps1), the pre-action confirmations
#  (Settings tab: snapshot, Trellix ...), a re-check - and for a removal
#  one more confirmation.
#
#  ON THE SERVER each item runs as a one-shot scheduled task (SYSTEM, in
#  the task folder \WinRMToolkit\) instead of inside the WinRM session:
#    - the VMware Tools installer replaces the network driver; the WinRM
#      connection drops, the task does not
#    - installers get a full SYSTEM token, not a network logon
#  The tasks of one run are queued and started one at a time (Windows
#  Installer runs one install at a time - exit 1618 otherwise); each poll
#  collects finished items, writes the server's own record (Application
#  event 910, C:\PatchStaging\change-log.txt, a result file) and starts the
#  next.  If the tool goes away, nothing new starts on its own.

WHERE TO FIND SOFTWARE UPDATES  (on a machine that has internet, then copy the files into software\<package>\)

The Software console deploys only what data\software-packages.psd1 describes: the folder, the file pattern, the
signer and the exact silent command line of each package. The reboot is always suppressed, so it can be taken
together with the OS patches ("Reboot ticked servers").

A. VMWARE TOOLS - DEPLOYED BY THIS TOOL, NOT BY VCENTER
   1. Download - NO BROADCOM ACCOUNT NEEDED. Every release is published openly at
      https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/ - open the version folder, then windows, then x64.
   2. Example, VMware Tools 12.5.4:
      https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/12.5.4/windows/x64/
      - take the .exe in that folder, VMware-tools-12.5.4-24964629-x64.exe (the 64-bit Windows installer). The
      newest release is always in https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/latest/windows/x64/
   3. ESXi hosts: the release notes do not list ESXi versions; they point to the Broadcom Product Interoperability
      Matrix, https://interopmatrix.broadcom.com (VMware Tools against VMware vSphere ESXi). VMware Tools is upgraded
      independently of vSphere, but only the matrix says whether a release is supported on your hosts.
   4. Windows: read the release notes of the release you deploy. For 12.5.4 they say: 64-bit Windows from Windows 7
      SP1 / Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 on, and the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable (x86 and x64)
      version 14.40.33816 is a prerequisite - installing or upgrading is not supported without it. Minimum VMware
      Tools per Windows Server version (Broadcom KB 313371): 2016 and 2019 - 10.1.0; 2022 - 10.3.5 (12.0.0
      recommended); 2025 - 11.3.0 (12.5.0 recommended). The Windows version must also be supported on your ESXi
      version: the VMware Compatibility Guide, guest operating systems.
   5. Copy the file into software\VMwareTools\ and press "Reload lists + packages". Keep the file name: the version
      is read from it (VMware-tools-12.5.4-24964629-x64.exe gives 12.5.4.24964629; older releases end -x86_64.exe
      and are read the same way). The tool checks that the file is signed by VMware or Broadcom and shows its SHA256
      (hover the installer's row);
      a file that fails is listed as BLOCKED with the reason. If your change process wants a checksum,
      Get-FileHash <file> -Algorithm SHA256 gives the same value.
   6. Stop vSphere upgrading the Tools of these VMs, or vCenter and this tool take turns: VM > Edit Settings > VM
      Options > VMware Tools > untick "Check and upgrade VMware Tools before each power on", and leave the VMs out
      of any vSphere Lifecycle Manager VMware Tools remediation.
   7. The command line comes from data\software-packages.psd1: the installer with /S /v and the MSI options /qn
      REBOOT=R and a log file, plus ADDLOCAL=ALL for a new install. REBOOT=R suppresses the reboot. Exit 3010 means
      a reboot completes it: take it with the OS patches.
   8. The installer may replace the VMXNET3 network driver, so the connection can drop for a few seconds. The
      install runs as a SYSTEM task on the server and carries on; the tool reconnects to read the result.
   9. The tool never removes VMware Tools (without it the VM loses its paravirtual network and storage drivers).

B. ANY OTHER PRODUCT - AN MSI WHERE THE VENDOR OFFERS ONE
   1. Get the vendor's MSI, or an .exe with a documented silent switch AND a no-reboot switch, from the vendor
      portal. Check its SHA256 against the vendor's.
   2. Put the file in any folder under software\ (any name, spaces fine, e.g. software\Google Chrome\) and press
      Reload lists + packages. It shows as * NEW in a yellow box under the installer list.
   3. Press Register... next to it. The form is filled from the file: name, version
      source, file pattern, the signer to trust, and names the fleet's inventory has seen for Match. For an .exe,
      give the vendor's silent switches - they must suppress the reboot (REBOOT=R, REBOOT=ReallySuppress or
      /norestart) or the form refuses. Install, Update and Uninstall start ticked: leave Uninstall ticked unless the
      product must never be removed (unticked, UNINSTALL refuses it - right for VMware Tools, wrong for an ordinary
      application). The preview shows the exact command lines; Register writes the package into
      data\software-packages.psd1.
   4. Later versions dropped into the same folder are picked up by the file pattern - no new registration.
   5. To change a registration later, press Edit... next to any of its installers in the installer list: the same
      form, filled from the entry. Save changes rewrites only that entry; its comments are kept.

C. WHICH PRODUCTS NEED ATTENTION
   The inventory list on the Software tab (and the O/S Patching console's software grid) marks products Behind,
   Stale, Ageing or End of life against data\known-apps.psd1 and the rest of the fleet. For the vendor's current
   version use its release notes or download page, and record it as Latest in known-apps.psd1 so every server is
   judged against it.

D. REMOVING SOFTWARE
   Tick products in the inventory list, then UNINSTALL. An MSI product is removed with msiexec /x <product code>
   /qn /norestart REBOOT=ReallySuppress; another product with its own QuietUninstallString, with that
   uninstaller's no-restart switches added (Inno Setup /NORESTART /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES, WiX bundles /norestart).
   An uninstaller with no known switch shows "quiet (may restart)" and the plan warns. Never removed: products
   with neither, protected products (ProtectedProducts in software-packages.psd1, or a package without
   Uninstall - Edit... ticks it) and products the server's SOE standard requires. "dormant" in the Use column =
   installed long ago and nothing on the server uses its folder (no service, process or task): confirm with the
   owner first. After a removal the server reads "advised: removed ..." until its next reboot: plan that reboot
   as its own step - it finishes what the uninstaller left for the next start.

SANITY CHECKS
   * One version per package per run. The plan shows the installed version, the target and why a server is
     skipped before anything is asked.
   * Every install, update, removal and reboot asks for a change reference. It is kept in changes\change-log.csv
     and on the server: Application event 910 (920 for a reboot) and C:\PatchStaging\change-log.txt.
   * After a run the inventory is read again. A version that has not moved yet may mean the installer is still
     finishing - press Check again in a few minutes.
