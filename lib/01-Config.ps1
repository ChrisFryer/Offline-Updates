#  01-Config.ps1  -  SETTINGS AND SHARED STATE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Everything an operator might want to tweak lives in $script:Config.
#  These are the defaults: the Settings tab saves the operator's changes
#  in settings\settings.json and lib\12-Settings.ps1 lays them over the
#  defaults at start-up.
#  Everything the tool remembers while it runs (credentials, last known
#  server status, loaded lists) lives in the other $script: variables
#  below.  From the console you can inspect any of them at any time,
#  for example:   $Config        $ServerStatus        $Patches
#
#  NOTE: "$script:" simply means "a variable shared by all the files of
#  this tool".  When the launcher is dot-sourced in a console ($NoGui)
#  it is the same as a normal global variable.

#  REVIEW RECORD  -  01-Config.ps1
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Independent review 2026-10-14 (see CODE-REVIEW.md).  Changed here:
#  new settings RequireValidSignature and AllowUnknownTargetBuild (R-09,
#  R-11); $script:Operator for the audit trail (R-18).  R-25 (a second
#  Invoke-Expression run in the same console kept the OLD root folder) was
#  fixed in the all-in-one header, retired 2026-10-21 with the paste mode.
