    #  update or remove, and exactly how.
    # -----------------------------------------------------------------
    #  Each package names a folder under software\ (Folder, else its Id);
    #  installer files there that match FilePattern are offered for the
    #  modes listed.  The command line is built from this file only:
    #  nothing typed in the window reaches the server's command line.
    #
    #  The easy way to add one: drop the installer into any folder under
    #  software\, then in the Software tab press Register... next to it
    #  (it shows as * NEW under the installers) - a form filled from the file writes
    #  the entry at the end of the Packages list.  To change an entry later,
    #  press Edit... next to one of its installers: the same form rewrites that
    #  entry only, comments kept.  Hand edits work too.
    #
    #  Fields
    #    Id            the package's name in the tool, unique, any text:
    #                  its grid column, and its folder on the servers
    #                  (C:\PatchStaging\software\<Id, spaces as _>)
    #    Folder        optional: its folder under software\ on this PC -
    #                  any name, spaces and sub-folders (Vendor\Product)
    #                  allowed; without it the folder is the Id
    #    Name          shown in the window, the plan and the change log
    #    Match         -like pattern for the product's DisplayName in the
    #                  Uninstall registry (how "installed?" is answered)

    #                  joined with dots); 'msi' = ProductVersion inside the

    #    Signers       the O= of the Authenticode signer must START with
