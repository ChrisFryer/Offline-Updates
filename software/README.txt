software\  -  installer files for the Software console
=================================================================

Put an installer in any folder you like under software\ - any name, spaces
and sub-folders are fine, e.g.  software\Google Chrome\  or
software\Vendor\Product\.  Press Reload lists + packages in the Software tab:

  * a file a package already claims is offered (ready to tick)
  * any other .msi or .exe shows as * NEW in a yellow box under the
    installer list, with its own Register... button: a form filled from the file (name,
    version, signer, file pattern) writes the package into
    data\software-packages.psd1.  Register once per product; later versions
    dropped into the same folder are picked up by the file pattern.
    Uninstall starts ticked; unticked, the tool never removes the product.
  * every offered file has an Edit... button: the same form, to change its
    package's registration later (only that entry is rewritten).
  * other file types (.msp, .zip, .iso ...) are listed as not usable.

Each offered file is vetted before it can be ticked:
  * version   from the file name (VersionRegex) or from inside the file
  * signature Authenticode Valid, signed by one of the package's Signers
  * SHA256    checked again on the server right before it runs
  * arguments an .exe package must suppress the reboot

Keep the vendor's file name.  Older versions may stay in the folder; tick
the one to deploy (one version per package per run).

Installer files are git-ignored (*.exe, *.msi, *.msp, *.zip): they are
large and they are not ours to publish.

software\_info\ is the tool's own: vetting-cache.json keeps the SHA256,
signature and version of every installer, so a big library is not read in
full at every start.  Safe to delete (the next start vets every file
again).  It is git-ignored, and no package may use _info as its folder.

A big library: the Software tab shows at most MaxSoftwareColumns packages
at once (6 by default, Settings tab); its "Software library..." window
lists them all and picks which.

VMware Tools - no Broadcom account needed:
  https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/<version>/windows/x64/
  e.g. https://packages.vmware.com/tools/releases/12.5.4/windows/x64/
  take VMware-tools-12.5.4-24964629-x64.exe and put it in software\VMwareTools\.
  Before deploying a release, check it against your ESXi hosts (Broadcom Product
  Interoperability Matrix) and your Windows versions (its release notes).
Everything else: the "Where do I get software?" button on the Software tab.
